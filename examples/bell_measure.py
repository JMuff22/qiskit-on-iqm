"""This file is an example of using Qiskit on IQM to execute a simple but non-trivial quantum circuit on an IQM quantum
computer.
1. Download this file
2. Install Qiskit on IQM as instructed in the user guide:
  https://iqm-finland.github.io/qiskit-on-iqm/user_guide.html#installation
3. Install Cortex CLI and log in as instructed here:
  https://iqm-finland.github.io/cortex-cli/readme.html#installing-cortex-cli
4. Set the environment variable as instructed by Cortex CLI after logging in
5. Run `python bell_measure.py --server_url https://demo.qc.iqm.fi/cocos` â€“ replace the example URL with the correct URL
6. The output should show that almost half of the measurements resulted in '00' and almost half in '11'
